# FRET-Calc 

Förster Resonance Energy Transfer Calculator (FRET-Calc) is a Python GUI software that analyzes experimental data for molar extinction coefficient of the acceptor, emission spectrum of the donor, and the refractive index spectrum of the donor/acceptor blend. Therefore, the main goal of this software is to obtain the principal parameters involved in FRET process, such as: (i) Effective refractive index, (ii) overlap integral, (iii) Förster radius, (iii) FRET efficiency and (iv) FRET rate.
